Advanced Spring Profiles
- 

example usage of spring profiles for better understanding.

Purpose 
-
- Implementing continuous delivery principles - possibility to safe and fast turning on/off either whole module or specific feature without changing application/system code base.
- Code modularisation for better configuration maintenance.
- Code modularisation for painless extraction to separate system or subsystem*


*applies only if module is canonical. Extracting composite modules might be painful as these might contain other canonical or composite modules, etc.

Requirements
- 
- gradle 5.1.1
- java 11
